Hello
=====

You've reached my private (but public) Github repository.

In here, you'll find some modules that do some stuff in Odoo. They're mostly personal-use oriented (i.e. not meant to use by *corporate* people).

Most of it are pet projects or just some ideas that may stay unfinished for a long time.

Unless otherwise specified in the module manifest (the `__openerp__.py` file), these files are distributed under the LGPLv3.

Have a nice day.
